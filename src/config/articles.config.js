The <strong>Total Value Permanently Locked</strong> (TVPL), which displays the ever-increasing underlying assets that are backing CORE, is currently $13 Million. In combination with $27 Million of <strong>Total Liquidity Locked</strong> (TLL), these unique metrics distinguish CORE from all other DeFi projects, making it one of most undervalued assets in this space.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>The Black Hole of Liquidity </strong>üí´</h3>\n<p>The architecture of CORE creates several <strong>compounding loops</strong> inside the system which directly affect the token value.<br>Every coin that runs through CORE‚Äôs ecosystem is charged with a fee which gradually raises the valuation of the whole system. <br>The diagram shows the concatenation of events when CORE is swapped. Uniswap has a transaction fee of 0.3% which it distributes to liquidity providers.',

While Bitcoin advocates remain cautious around new trends, a recent increase in wBTC (wrapped Bitcoin) shows that a growing number of long term supporters is looking at DeFi to profit from their holdings.<br>In the past month, a record $600 million worth of tokenized Bitcoins have been minted, ready to empower decentralized finance.',

Carefully blending pairs with different characteristics, strengthens the diversification of CORE and adds new vectors to generating these rewards. <br>Introducing a second pair, linked to CORE, has an impact on fees generated.<br>Due to CORE being the common denominator between the two liquidity pools, holding CORE/wBTC LP tokens, ties you to BTC fluctuations against CORE and ETH. The provided liquidity by our pools invites arbitrage opportunities to take place which in return creates additional fees for the LP token holders. <strong class="hr kr">Arbitrage</strong> is the process of earning a ‚Äúriskless‚Äù profit by taking advantage of different prices for the same good<strong class="hr kr">. </strong>CORE creates a welcoming environment by locking liquidity and then charging 1% to use it. This balance creates opportunity for traders and rewards its LP token holders.</p>',
