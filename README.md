When making changes to a repo, it is important to be able to clearly identify distinct changes. Because auto-styling tools do not discriminate between new and old code, these tools cause problems with merging and tracking changes in the code. If you are unhappy with the style of the project, you can run an auto-formatting tool, but it must be in an exclusive commit, and you need everyone to update with this formatting at roughly the same time, or else merging becomes nearly impossible. In general, it is simply better to format code as it is edited, by hand. If you commit code with an auto-formatting tool by accident, back it out.
